1. What was the bug? <br>
  
   The bug in this code is that the num1 and num2 variables are being treated as strings, so the + operator in the 
   calculateSum() function is performing string concatenation instead of numerical addition. <br>
  
2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) <br>

   I would convert num1 and num2 to numbers before performing the addition.
